# Money Counter — agent guide

Personal finance app: track ~10 bank accounts (multiple currencies), their
transactions, balances, categories, and bank-statement imports (CSV/TSV). Single
user, self-hosted. See `README.md` for the user-facing intro and Docker demo;
this file is the working context for code changes.

## Stack

- **React 19** client UI rendered by **vinext** (a Vite-based Next-like framework; `app/` routing, `app/api/*/route.ts` handlers).
- **Cloudflare Workers + D1** (SQLite) as the runtime and database. D1 binding is named `DB` (`.openai/hosting.json`).
- **Drizzle ORM** schema in `db/schema.ts` (used by `drizzle-kit`), but at runtime tables are created by `ensureSchema()` — see Gotchas.
- Tailwind v4 is installed but the UI is plain CSS in `app/globals.css`.
- No test runner is configured (see Testing).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — local dev. vinext serves on the first free port from **3000** up (3001, 3002, …); miniflare auto-creates a local D1. Watch the log for the URL.
- `npm run build` — production build; run this to verify changes compile end-to-end.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with the strict React-compiler rules (see Gotchas). **Always run before finishing.**
- `npm run db:generate` — regenerate Drizzle migrations after editing `db/schema.ts` (not required to make tables work at runtime).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — typecheck.

(`npm` and `pnpm` lockfiles both exist; either works.)

## Deploy

**Deploy after every code change by default** — commit to `main`, push, then run
the two steps below. The user demos the live app to a customer who cannot look at
the dev laptop, so changes must reach the running deployment automatically. Skip
deploying ONLY when the user explicitly says not to (e.g. "не выкатывай").

Exactly these two steps — do NOT change the image tag.

1. Build & push:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --ssh default --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -f Dockerfile . --tag ghcr.io/sapphireqt/money_counter:build-002 --push
   ```
2. Restart:
   ```bash
   kubectl --context lab rollout restart deploy money-counter -n money-counter
   ```

## Architecture / key files

- `app/money-counter.tsx` — the **entire UI**, one big client component (`"use client"`). A **left sidebar** switches sections: **Операции** (period-filtered, day-grouped list + summary cards + a right-hand «Счета» balance panel), **Настройки** (sub-tabs **Счета / Категории / Валюты**; auto-rules live under Категории), **Визуализация** (cashflow bars + category pie), plus empty placeholders **Прогнозирование** and **Займы** (live backlog). **Every list add/edit form opens in a modal** (top-right «Добавить» + a pencil per row) — mirror this pattern for new lists. Holds all state and data-loading; small helpers (`Money`, `Flagged`, `EditIcon`, `CategoryPie`, `MonthPicker`, `convertTotals`, `donutPath`) live in the same file. `app/page.tsx` just renders it.
- `app/globals.css` — all styling (sidebar nav, lists, modals, charts, pie, import panel).
- `lib/finance.ts` — **pure** money/date/format helpers: `parseMoneyInputToCents`, `parseFlexibleDate`/`normalizeDateInput`, `resolveSignedAmountCents`, `formatMoney`, `normalizeCurrency`, `normalizeColor`, `matchCategoryRule`, `accountTypes`.
- `lib/import.ts` — **pure, framework-free** bank-statement import engine. Entry point `analyzeImport(text, {defaultCurrency})` → `{delimiter, headers, dataRows, mapping, rows, …}`. Also `detectDelimiter`, `parseDelimited`, `guessMapping`, `buildRows`, `resolveRowCents`, `detectAmountSigned`, `FIELD_DEFS`. Handles CSV/TSV/`;`/`|`, quotes/BOM/CRLF, EN/RU/ES/DE/FR/IT headers, split debit/credit, fees, signed vs direction-column amounts, and a header-row finder for preamble lines.
- `db/index.ts` — `getD1()`, `getDb()` (drizzle), and `ensureSchema()` (the real runtime migration; see Gotchas).
- `app/api/*/route.ts` — handlers: `accounts` (GET also `?asOf=YYYY-MM-DD` → balance as of a date, exclusive of it; POST/PATCH/DELETE), `transactions` (GET `from`/`to`/`accountId`/`q`/`type`/`limit`; POST/PATCH/DELETE — writes into a closed period are rejected 409, see Data model), `import` (also rejects rows in closed periods), `categories` (CRUD; PATCH renames, guards case-insensitive clashes), `rules` (CRUD), `rules/apply` (`?overwrite=1` re-runs over ALL transactions, not just uncategorized), `currencies` (CRUD — the currency reference book), `rates` (FX + crypto, see Data model), `periods` (GET months + open/closed status; POST `{month, open}` reopens/closes a past month), `stats`. No bulk-delete endpoint exists (delete is per-id).

### Import data flow (important)
Parsing happens **client-side** in `lib/import.ts`. The browser sends already-parsed rows to `POST /api/import` as `{ rows, accountId? }`. The route does NOT re-parse columns — it only validates date/amount, resolves the account, applies category rules, dedups, and batch-inserts. A bank statement has no "account" column, so the UI makes the user pick/create the target account (`accountId`). **Omit `accountId`** and the route instead resolves each row's account by `accountName`+`currency`, **auto-creating missing accounts** (opening balance 0) — this is how a multi-account historical import works (`scripts/import-sheets.mjs`).

## Data model & conventions

- **Money is integer cents** everywhere (`amount_cents`, `opening_balance_cents`). Convert at the edges only.
- **Dates are TEXT `YYYY-MM-DD`** (timezone-free). Range queries compare strings.
- **Currency lives on the account**, not the transaction. **Never sum across currencies** in storage/SQL — group per-currency or filter by a single currency (the `/api/stats` `currency` param). Account balance = opening balance + sum of its transactions (computed in SQL in `accounts` route).
- **Currencies are a reference book** (`currencies` table: `code` PK, `name`, `symbol`), seeded in `ensureSchema()` and managed under Настройки → Валюты; the account form picks its currency from it. `normalizeCurrency` accepts **3–5 letters** (fiat + crypto tickers like `USDT`).
- **Display-currency conversion (UI only)**: the user can view all money in one chosen currency. `GET /api/rates?date&currencies` returns USD-based rates: fiat from the keyless **Frankfurter** API; crypto tickers (TRX, BTC…) from **Kraken's** keyless public OHLC API (`<CODE>USD` daily close, stored as `usd_rate = 1/close`), falling back to **Binance** (`<CODE>USDT` daily close, USDT≈USD) for dates beyond Kraken's window; **USDT is pegged to exactly 1** by design (user's accounting convention, keeps Binance-quoted conversions consistent). All cached in `exchange_rates` (historical rates are immutable). `convertTotals()` converts per-currency maps to the display currency; summary cards convert at the period's **first-day** rate, the «Счета» panel at the current month's first-day rate — or the period's **last-day** rate when the selected period is closed (frozen view). A currency with no rate is summed-out and **flagged** in the UI (never silently wrong).
- **Reporting periods freeze**: a calendar month before the current (UTC) one is **closed** unless listed in `open_periods` (reopened via the UI toggle next to the month picker / `POST /api/periods`). Closed months reject transaction POST/PATCH/DELETE and import rows with 409 (`findClosedMonths()` in `db/index.ts`); the UI disables row edit/delete and shows the «Счета» panel as of the period end (`?asOf=<next month>-01`, converted at the last-day rate). Reopen → edit → close recalculates honestly; nothing is snapshotted, so numbers can only change through deliberate edits. `rules/apply` and account opening-balance edits are deliberately NOT guarded (they don't move period money… opening balance does — accepted trade-off, it's an account-level setting).
- **Category is a free-text string** on `transactions.category` (the category *name*). The `categories` table is a managed vocabulary (for the picker + pie colors); identity is **case-insensitive** — keep all write paths consistent (compare via `LOWER(name)`).
- **Auto-categorization**: `category_rules` (pattern → category). Applied **only when a row's category is empty**, on import and on manual `POST /api/transactions`, via `matchCategoryRule` (case-insensitive substring match on description, then payee). `POST /api/rules/apply` retro-applies to uncategorized transactions.

## Gotchas (read before changing related code)

- **Schema migrations: edit `ensureSchema()` in `db/index.ts`.** It runs `CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` on every request, so adding a table there makes it appear with no manual migration step. Mirror the change in `db/schema.ts` for `drizzle-kit`, but `db/schema.ts` is NOT what creates tables at runtime.
- **Date validation rejects impossible days.** `parseFlexibleDate`/`normalizeDateInput` return `null` for e.g. `2026-02-31` or `2026-06-31`. So **never use `YYYY-MM-31` as a generic month-end bound** — compute the real last day (`monthEnd()` in `money-counter.tsx` uses `new Date(year, month, 0)`). This previously caused range queries to silently drop their upper bound for 30-day months/February.
- **React compiler ESLint is strict** (errors, not warnings): (1) don't reassign a variable created during render — use pure/functional patterns (e.g. prefix-sum instead of a mutated accumulator); (2) don't call `setState` synchronously in a `useEffect` body — wrap async work in an async IIFE (`useEffect(() => { void (async () => { … })(); }, [...])`). `npm run lint` catches both.
- **Import dedup is DB-seeded only.** Fingerprints (`accountId|date|amountCents|description`) come from existing DB rows, so re-importing an overlapping period is idempotent, but two genuinely identical rows in one file both import.
- **A bank "Type" column is deliberately NOT mapped to `category`** (it's a payment method like "Card Payment", not a spending category). Real `Category`/`Категория` columns still map. This keeps the user's auto-rules in control of categorization.
- The transactions list uses `LIMIT` (500); always pair it with `from`/`to` period filters so rows aren't truncated.
- **Crypto rate sources are a chain: Kraken (~720-day window, USD-quoted) → Binance (full history since a pair's listing, USDT-quoted).** A coin neither lists stays missing → flagged («нет курса»). `api.binance.com` is geo-blocked in some jurisdictions — if the deployment moves, verify egress. Never accept a candle from a DIFFERENT day than requested, and never CACHE today's candle (it is still forming) — both would poison the immutable `exchange_rates` cache.
- **Frankfurter rejects the whole request (HTTP 422) if `quotes` contains any unsupported code** — it does NOT silently skip them. `/api/rates` therefore partitions codes via `GET /v2/currencies` first and sends only supported ones; everything else goes to the Kraken fallback. Don't put crypto tickers into the Frankfurter request.
- **`Intl.NumberFormat` throws on non-ISO (4–5-letter) currency codes** like `USDT`. `formatMoneyParts` in `lib/finance.ts` has a fallback (plain number + code suffix) — route any money formatting through it, never call Intl with a raw account currency elsewhere.
- **Historical imports vs closed periods.** `POST /api/import` is all-or-nothing rejected if ANY row (even a would-be duplicate) dates into a closed month — reopen the months first (`scripts/import-sheets.mjs` against prod now needs that too).
- **`ca-certificates` in the Dockerfile is required** for outbound HTTPS: workerd verifies TLS against the system store, which `node:slim` lacks — without it the FX-rate fetch fails with «unable to get local issuer certificate». Don't remove that `apt-get` line.

## Testing

No test runner. Verify changes by layer:

- **Pure libs (`lib/finance.ts`, `lib/import.ts`)** run in Node with type-stripping. They use extensionless relative imports (`./finance`), which Node ESM won't resolve, so add a tiny resolve hook:
  ```js
  // resolve-ts.mjs
  import { existsSync } from "node:fs";
  export async function resolve(spec, ctx, next) {
    if (/^\.\.?\//.test(spec) && !/\.[a-z]+$/.test(spec)) {
      const url = new URL(spec + ".ts", ctx.parentURL);
      if (existsSync(url)) return { url: url.href, shortCircuit: true };
    }
    return next(spec, ctx);
  }
  // register.mjs: import { register } from "node:module"; register("./resolve-ts.mjs", import.meta.url);
  ```
  Then `node --experimental-strip-types --import ./register.mjs your-test.ts`, importing libs by absolute path.
- **API + D1 flows**: `npm run dev`, then `curl`/`fetch` the endpoints (miniflare gives a real local D1). Create an account first, then import/transactions. The local SQLite lives at `.wrangler/state/v3/d1/miniflare-D1DatabaseObject/<hash>.sqlite` (the one with an `accounts` table) — inspect/clean it with `sqlite3` directly. Remember to clean up test rows.
- A known-good fixture: a Revolut statement is comma-delimited despite a `.tsv` extension; its movement total reconciles to `finalBalance − balanceBeforeFirstRow`.
- **One-off migration**: `scripts/import-sheets.mjs` imports monthly Google-Sheets tabs (CSV export) via `POST /api/import` — dry-run by default, `--post <baseUrl>` writes; idempotent via the import dedup. Run against prod through `kubectl port-forward` to the pod.

## Conventions

- Code, identifiers, comments: English. UI strings: Russian. Money/dates as above.
- Match the existing single-file UI style and the route-handler error pattern (`toRouteErrorMessage`, which special-cases "no such table").
- After making code changes, the default is to commit to `main`, push, and deploy (see Deploy) automatically — do NOT wait to be asked, and do NOT create a feature branch. This overrides the global "commit/push only when asked" and "branch first on main" rules. The only exception is when the user explicitly says not to commit/deploy.
